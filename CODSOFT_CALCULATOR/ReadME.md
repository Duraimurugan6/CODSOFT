# Calculator - Python Application

## Overview

This is a simple command-line calculator application written in Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can be extended to handle more advanced operations.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another (with error handling for division by zero).
- **Modulus**: Calculates the remainder of a division.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-python.git
    cd calculator-python
    ```

2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to perform calculations.

## Usage

Once you run the application, you'll see prompts for selecting an operation and entering numbers.

```
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
6. Exit
```

You can select an option by entering the corresponding number, followed by entering the numbers to be calculated.

### Example

```
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
6. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 8
Result: 20
```

## File Structure

- `calculator.py`: The main script containing the logic for the calculator operations.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced functions such as square root, power, and trigonometric operations.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
- Add support for continuous calculations (using previous results in subsequent operations).
- Add a history feature to track previous calculations.
